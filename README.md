# springboot-securityProject
A webapp focusing on the usage of Springboot Security

The project is ready to be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster and is just a matter of request the url of the pod, in the case you´re running Minikube you could run this command in order to expose the service provided by authproject:

minikube service authproject --url

then it´ll just be a copy and paste of the address into your browser to run.

Happy coding :)!!!!
